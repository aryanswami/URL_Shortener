# URL_Shortener

URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are unique resources that specify the addresses of webpages on the internet. URLs often tend to be long and complex which makes them difficult to interpret and track. Therefore, as a  part of my internship project, I created a URL shortener to tackle this problem. A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL as an input and converts it into a shorter, more manageable URL which is easy to handle and interpret. This shortened URL can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as sharing links on social media platforms where characters limits are in place, making it easier to remember and type a URL, also reducing the amount of space the URL takes up.
This project is implemented using programming languages like Python for back-end and HTML,JavaScript, and CSS for front-end. I have utilized Amazon Web Services to create the serverless RESTful assets. 


The user stories were as follows:
1. As an end user I should be able to shorten a URL, which acts as a replacement for the original long URL.
2. As an end user, I should be able to copy the URL to clipboard and paste it on any web browser.
3. As an end user, I should be able to use the URL shortener on various devices.
4. As an end user, I should be able to share the shortened URL on various social media platforms.
5. As an end user, if I enter an invalid shortened, I should be notified that the URL is invalid.
6. As an end user, I need an option to save my previous shortened URLs.
